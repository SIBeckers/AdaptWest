# Outlining steps/features/to-dos for the beta version
1.	Home Tab
+	Harmonization of the look of the images (bottom two have shadows, etc).
	
2.	Climate Metrics Tour
+	Currently I think the opacity slider isn’t working properly, seems like you have to move to the next step and back for the effect to take place. Works okay for the single maps, but not for the double map.

3.	Climate Metrics Explorer

+ Selector for Report.

4.	PA Tour
+ Currently I think the opacity slider isn’t working properly, seems like you have to move to the next step and back for the effect to take place. Works okay for the single maps, but not for the double map.


5.	PA Explorer
+ Selector for report

6.	Reporting
++	XY plot?
+	What else?

                
7.	Versioning/GitHub
+ I've created a private repository on github that I will start syncing to occasionally. Right now the data isn't there but the app structure etc is.

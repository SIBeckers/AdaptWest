# AdaptWest Climate Metrics Application Code

## About 
This repository contains the R code, javascript, html and other files needed to create the AdaptWest Climate Metrics web-app.
The application is currently in development.

The data needed for the app are now available in this repository but can be made available upon request.
The application will be archived through Zenodo (releases) but may be updated over time.

The application was written by Justin F. Beckers and Carlos Carroll. 
Most of the application logic, ui, plots, etc. were done by Justin F. Beckers while Carlos Carroll provided
scientific content, direction on features, feedback on app.

The application code here includes configuration for shinyapps.io and for running locally.
Running locally can be done with local tiles or using web tiles.

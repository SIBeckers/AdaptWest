### **Protected Area Explorer**
<br>
Expansion of the global protected area network and more effective placement of new protected areas are increasingly seen as critical measures to counter threats arising from the twin crises of accelerating climate change and species extinction. A key step in increasing the effectiveness of protected area expansion is a better understanding of how threats to biodiversity from climate change impact the ability of protected areas to sustain species and ecosystems.
<br>
<br>
The goals of the **Yellowstone-to-Yukon Protected Area Tour** are to familiarize conservation practitioners with the landscape-level characteristics that can help in evaluating climate-change-related threats to the integrity of protected areas, and conversely the role such areas may play in enhancing the climate resilience of the broader region. The figure below from [Watson and Venter 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24144) highlights three ways in which climate resilience data can aid protected area strategies by informing prioritization of new areas for protection or contributing to vulnerability assessments and management strategies for existing protected areas.
<br>
<br>
In this tour, we consider landscape metrics related to both climate mitigation (safeguarding ecosystems in their ability to store above- and below-ground carbon) and climate adaptation and resilience (for example, the ability of an area to provide climate refugia). For more information on the metrics considered here, see the Climate Resilience Data Viewer's **Climate Metrics Tour** and **Climate Metrics Explorer**.

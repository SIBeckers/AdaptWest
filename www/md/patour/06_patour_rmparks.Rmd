The starplot for this region indicates that the Rocky Mountain Parks have high value as macrorefugia based on both backward climatic velocity and species models. 
The region's high topodiversity also supports abundant microrefugia. However, because the mountains to the north of the Rocky Mountain parks are of lower elevation, alpine ecosystems in this area show high levels of threat as measured by forward climatic velocity.

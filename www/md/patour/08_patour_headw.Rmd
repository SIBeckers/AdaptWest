### **Yellowstone-to-Yukon Protected Area Tour**
### **7. Spatsizi and Mount Edziza parks**
Spatsizi and Mount Edziza parks form part of the "Sacred Headwaters" region, which encompasses the sources of three important rivers of coastal BC and Alaska - the Skeena, Nass and Stikine.

The starplot for this area shows high values for macrorefugia based on both climate (backward velocity) and species models.
The high topodiversity of the region provides a high potential for microrefugia.
The area also encompasses important climate corridors, and forms a key linkage between coastal and interior ecosystems.
Unlike protected areas to the north and east, this region has a low potential to protect soil carbon.

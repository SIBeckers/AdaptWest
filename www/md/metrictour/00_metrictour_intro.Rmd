### AdaptWest Climate Metrics Tour

Conservation planners and practitioners increasingly wonder how they should revise conservation strategies in the face of the unprecedented threat to biodiversity from climate change. One key step is to consider the relatively consistent spatial patterns that characterize the "geography of climate exposure and resilience". These patterns are often generated by the interaction of global climate systems with regional topography, but may also be influenced by biogeographic processes and other factors. A qualitative understanding of these patterns can help planners craft conservation strategies that are more resilient to uncertainty regarding the future intensity of climate change.
<br>
In this Climate Metrics Tour, we review eight key metrics that are used to assess landscape-level climate resilience and vulnerability. The subsequent portions of the Tour are devoted to explaining what each of these metrics represent and why they are relevant to climate adaptation planning. Spatial data shown in this Tour are freely available at the links below.

  
  **Climate Resilience Metric:**
  
  * [Climatic dissimilarity](https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/climatic-dissimilarity) 
  * [Forward and backward climatic velocity](https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/adaptwest-velocitywna)
  * [Topodiversity](https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/environmental-diversity-north-america)
  * [Biotic velocity](https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/climatic-macrorefugia-for-trees-and-songbirds)
  * [Climate connectivity](https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/climate-connectivity-north-america)
  * [Aboveground forest carbon](http://globbiomass.org/wp-content/uploads/GB_Maps/Globbiomass_global_dataset.html)
  * [Soil carbon](https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c02ddf8b-cbfb-4533-a9c3-7bf0790fd042)
  * [Intactness (the inverse of landuse intensity)](https://figshare.com/articles/Global_Human_Modification/7283087)
  

The goals of this **Climate Metrics Tour** are to:

  * Explore how conservation initiatives can enhance climate resilience and connectivity;
  * Make climate resilience concepts more accessible to practitioners;
  * Familiarize users with climate change threats and the information resources that can help address these threats in the context of regional planning.
